Advanced Excel Data Visualization - Interactive Carousel

This project is an interactive, single-page infographic designed as a responsive carousel. It showcases the core principles of advanced data visualization, transforming a static guide into an engaging, animated narrative. The goal is to demonstrate both an understanding of effective data communication and the ability to implement a modern, dynamic front-end user experience. It's built to be a compelling portfolio piece, perfect for digital storytelling or as a standalone web presentation.

‚ú® Features

This project is packed with features designed to create an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

Interactive Carousel & Navigation

Smooth Transitions: Slides animate in and out with clean, modern transitions.

Multiple Controls: Navigate using previous/next buttons, clickable indicator dots, or keyboard arrow keys.

Progress Bar: A sleek progress bar at the top visually tracks the user's journey through the content.

Dynamic & Animated Charts

Chart.js Integration: Utilizes the powerful Chart.js library to render a variety of beautiful, animated charts.

Variety of Chart Types: Demonstrates the correct use case for multiple charts, including:

Bar & Column Charts

Line Charts

Doughnut & Pie Charts

Scatter Plots

Waterfall Charts

Funnel Charts

Engaging Animations: Charts animate into view, and KPI counters dynamically count up when they become visible, drawing the user's attention to key statistics.

Polished & Modern UI/UX

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive layout that looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Crisp Visuals: Uses scalable SVG icons and diagrams for a sharp, high-quality aesthetic on all screens.

Hover Effects: Interactive elements provide visual feedback on hover, creating a more responsive feel.

Portable & Self-Contained

Single-Page Application: The entire experience is contained within a single index.html file.

No External Dependencies: Relies only on CDN-hosted libraries, making it highly portable and easy to deploy on any static hosting service.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

This project was built from the ground up using modern front-end technologies to create a performant and maintainable single-page application.

HTML5: The core structure is built using semantic HTML5, ensuring accessibility and a logical document outline.

Tailwind CSS: All styling, from the overall layout to individual component design, is handled by the utility-first framework Tailwind CSS. This allows for rapid development and a consistent design system. A small, embedded <style> block is used for carousel-specific transition logic.

JavaScript (ES6+): The interactivity is powered by modern JavaScript.

Carousel Logic: A custom JavaScript module manages the state of the carousel, including the current slide, navigation logic, progress bar updates, and indicator dot states. It's built to be efficient, only rendering and animating charts when they become visible.

Chart.js: Charts are created and customized using the Chart.js library. Each chart is configured with specific options for responsiveness, custom tooltips, and engaging animations.

Intersection Observer API: The "animate on scroll" effect for the KPI counters is implemented efficiently using the Intersection Observer API, which triggers the animation only when the element enters the viewport.
